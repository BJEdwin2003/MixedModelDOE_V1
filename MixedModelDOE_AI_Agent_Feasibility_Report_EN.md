# Mixed Model DOE AI Agent Feasibility Report

## 1. Background

In the NPI (New Product Introduction) phase, DOE (Design of Experiments) is commonly used to analyze and separate configuration variance from pure error, optimizing processes and product performance. Traditional DOE analysis is often one-off and manually driven, making it difficult to adapt to the big data and real-time monitoring needs of mass production.

With the accumulation of mass production data, Mixed Model DOE can automatically separate various sources of variance, enabling real-time monitoring and continuous optimization of L, a, b color variances (Y variables). Automated analysis by an AI Agent allows for timely detection of process fluctuations and anomalies, supporting ongoing improvement and cost reduction.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Build a Python-based Mixed Model DOE analysis API to support automated and batch data analysis.
- Deploy as a web service (e.g., Render) and expose via OpenAPI for AI Agent integration.
- Develop and debug in VS Code, with optional support for a VS Code Extension.
- Enable AI Agent to automatically invoke DOE analysis and monitor variances in mass production data in real time.
- Explore the feasibility of AI Agent/machine learning for automatic tuning of analysis scripts or algorithms.

## 3. Technical Approach

- **Core Data Analysis**: Python + statsmodels/pandas/numpy, encapsulating Mixed Model DOE logic.
- **API Service**: FastAPI, supporting both file upload and JSON+base64 data input.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Render or similar platforms for high availability.
- **OpenAPI Integration**: Auto-generated API docs for easy AI Agent/external system calls.
- **AI Agent Integration**: Trigger DOE analysis automatically via Copilot Studio/AI Foundry, etc.
- **VS Code Extension**: Optional, for local development, debugging, and one-click deployment.
- **Auto-tuning Exploration**: Use machine learning/AutoML to analyze trends and automatically adjust analysis parameters or models.

## 4. Project Challenges

- Large-scale production data: cleaning, anomaly detection, and real-time requirements.
- Generality and extensibility of Mixed Model DOE scripts.
- Algorithm selection and safety for AI Agent auto-tuning.
- API stability and compatibility (e.g., multipart vs JSON+base64).
- Cross-platform integration (VS Code, cloud, AI platforms).
- Ongoing collaboration among data science, IT, and process engineering teams.

## 5. Resources & Support Needed

- Data scientists/algorithm engineers: develop and maintain analysis scripts, explore auto-tuning.
- IT/DevOps: API deployment, platform integration, automation.
- Process/quality engineers: define DOE plans, interpret results, drive process improvement.
- Production data interfaces and data governance support.
- AI platform (e.g., Copilot Studio/Foundry) accounts and API access.

## 6. Project Outlook

- Achieve automated and intelligent DOE analysis in mass production, enhancing process monitoring and optimization.
- Enable AI Agent to continuously learn and self-optimize, driving co-evolution of process and algorithms.
- Expand to more process parameters and product lines, moving toward full-process smart manufacturing.

## Appendix: Why Use an AI Agent Instead of Pure Python Scripts/AutoPower?

### Superior Automation & Integration

- Traditional Python scripts require manual or simple scheduled runs, making it hard to flexibly handle multiple data sources and triggers.
- AI Agents can seamlessly integrate with MES, databases, web services, message queues, etc., enabling event-driven or data-driven analysis without manual intervention.

### Intelligence & Adaptivity

- Traditional scripts have fixed parameters and logic, making it hard to auto-optimize based on data trends.
- Agents can leverage machine learning/AutoML to automatically adjust parameters, model structure, and even self-learn and evolve based on results.

### Scalability & Collaboration

- Agent platforms (e.g., Copilot Studio) support multi-agent collaboration, task decomposition, and cross-team reuse, making it easy to expand analysis functions.
- Support for multi-user, multi-role collaboration, with better permission management and auditing.

### Usability & Visualization

- Agents can be triggered and results viewed via natural language, web UI, API, etc., lowering the usage barrier.
- Facilitates collaboration and result sharing among business, process, and IT teams.

### Automated Monitoring & Alerts

- Agents can provide 24/7 monitoring, real-time detection of process fluctuations/anomalies, and automatic alerting and recommendations.

### Toward Intelligent Decision-Making Loops

- Agents can not only analyze but also generate improvement suggestions and even automatically issue process adjustment commands, forming a closed loop of data-analysis-decision-action.
